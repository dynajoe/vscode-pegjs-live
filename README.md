# vscode-pegjs

## Features

Live edit your PEGjs Grammars starting at the first rule or the rule under cursor.

## Tips

Name your grammar like this for optimal experience: `grammar_name.language_extension.pegjs`. Where `language_extension` is the extension of the language you're parsing. This will provide colorized text.
